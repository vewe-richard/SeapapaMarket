[![build status](https://gitlab.com/ci/projects/6571/status.png?ref=master)](https://gitlab.com/ci/projects/6571?ref=master) [![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/f-droid/-/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/f-droid/)

Client for [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org), the Free Software repository system
for Android.

## Building with Gradle

The only requirements are the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/)
and [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) 2.8:

    cd F-Droid
    gradle assembleRelease

## Direct download

You can [download the application](https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk) directly
from our site or [browse it in the repo](https://f-droid.org/app/org.fdroid.fdroid).

## Contributing

See our [Contributing doc](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to report
issues, translate the app into your language or help with development.

## IRC

We are on `#fdroid` and `#fdroid-dev` on Freenode. We hold weekly dev meetings
on `#fdroid-dev` on Tuesdays at 20h UTC, which usually last half an hour.
